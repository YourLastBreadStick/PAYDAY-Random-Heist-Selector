# PAYDAY-Random-Heist-Selector
Allows for the random selection of a heist from a user selected pool of heists from all 3 of the main line Payday games(PAYDAY: The Heist, PAYDAY 2, and PAYDAY 3)
# Documentation
The only thing that is accounted for when rolling for a heist is what check boxes are checked in the Individual Heists section, the Contractors and Methods are not used directly by the roller. You can set how many rows are in each section individually. The defaults are 1, 4, and 8 from top to bottom, this is a remnant from when this project was being made in Scratch. If you'd wish to have each section be perfect squares/rectangles then I have a list of factors you can use:
Methods: (1,3)
Payday 2's contractors: (1,16), (2,8), (4,4)
Payday 2's heists: (1,85), (5,17)
Payday 3's contractors: (1,8), (2,4)
Payday 3's heists: (1,16), (2,8), (4,4)
Like all my projects this will be updated based on how much I'm into the thing it's based on.
